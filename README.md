This is a project that was developed to allow non-Trello users to have access to see data (without having to login) and allow them to subscribe to notifications on cards or boards.

This requires a user that has access to the boards you wish to give access to. The appropriate key and token can be placed in the index.html file, the line loading the trello.js client. Whatever user's key and token set in that file will be used for the display and searching within the running app.
